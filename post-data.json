The Pakistan Super League (PSL) successfully completed its expansion from six to eight franchises, marking the league's transition into its most ambitious era yet.</p>
                
                <h2>The Big Bidders</h2>
                <p>The auction saw intense competition among ten technically qualified bidders. In a dramatic final round, the <strong>Sialkot</strong> franchise set a new league record, while <strong>Hyderabad</strong> secured its spot as the seventh team:</p>

                </ul>

                

                <h2>New Rivals, New Format</h2>
                <p>With the addition of these two cities, the PSL 11 (scheduled for March 26 to May 3, 2026) will feature a revamped schedule. PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi noted that the inclusion of Sialkot and Hyderabad will provide a massive boost to regional talent and local fan engagement.</p>

                    "Ten years of PSL have led us to this moment. The valuations we've seen tonight prove that the PSL is not just a cricket tournament; it is a global sporting brand that continues to grow." - Salman Naseer, PSL CEO.

                <p>In a significant shift for the 2021 champions, <strong>Ali Tareen</strong> officially announced his departure from the Multan Sultans franchise. After failing to reach a renewal agreement with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), the ownership rights reverted to the board on December 31, 2025.</p>
                
                <h2>The PCB's Interim Strategy</h2>
                <p>PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi has confirmed that the board will operate the Sultans as an "owner-less" team for the 2026 season. This move is designed to ensure the team's stability while the board prepares for a fresh auction after the tournament.</p>

                <h2>What’s Next for the Sultans?</h2>
                <p>While the board manages the business side, the cricket operations will be handled by a specially appointed interim management unit:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Management:</strong> A professional former cricketer will be appointed to lead operations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Squad:</strong> The team remains a powerhouse, led by Mohammad Rizwan, with stars like Usama Mir and Iftikhar Ahmed retained.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sale:</strong> A public auction for the franchise is expected to take place in late 2026 or early 2027.</li>
